## Module 1 - Introduction

In this module you will learn about the definition and essential characteristics of cloud computing. You will learn about the evolution of cloud computing and the factors that organizations need to consider while creating their cloud strategy. You will become familiar with some key cloud service providers and the services they offer. At the end of the module, you will learn how to create an account on a public cloud platform.
Learning Objectives

After completing this module, you will be able to:

*    Define cloud computing
*    Describe the essential characteristics of cloud computing
*    Briefly recount the history and evolution of cloud computing
*    Describe the key considerations that organizations can use as a guide while creating their cloud strategy
*    Describe the key cloud service providers and their services
*    Create an account on a public cloud platform

Let’s start with understanding the _five_ essential characteristics of the cloud—which include:
•	on-demand self-service, 
•	broad network access, 
•	resource pooling, 
•	rapid elasticity,
•	and measured service.

1. On-demand Self-service, the 1st characteristic, means that you get access to cloud resources such as the processing power, storage, and network you need, using a  simple interface, without requiring human interaction with each service provider.
2. The 2nd characteristic, Broad Network Access, means that cloud computing resources can be accessed via the network through standard mechanisms and platforms such as mobile phones, tablets, laptops, and workstations.
3. The 3rd characteristic, Resource Pooling, is what gives cloud providers economies of scale, which they pass on to their customers, making cloud cost-efficient.
Using a multi-tenant model, computing resources are pooled to serve multiple consumers; cloud resources are dynamically assigned and reassigned, according to demand, without customers needing to concern themselves with the physical location of these resources.
4. Rapid Elasticity, the 4th characteristic, implies that you can access more resources when you need them, and scale back when you don’t—because resources are elastically provisioned and released.
5. And the 5th characteristic, Measured Service, means that you only pay for what you use or reserve as you go; if you’re not using resources, you’re not paying.
Resource usage is monitored, measured, and reported transparently based on utilization.
